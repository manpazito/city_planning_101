# City Planning 101 - Lab Materials

This is where I'm storing my lab materials. If you are going to save this to computer, make sure to just **save this a zip file** and extract the files into your computer. There are some files you need to add in order for this to work.

## Missing files users must add

### 1. You need to add your `Assignment 2` sumission file. 
This should follow the format of: _[name]_[8-digit-num]_A2.csv_

### 2. You need to add your `CensusAPIKey.txt` file.
In the codebase I call API keys as a .txt file. Your .txt file should contain **your own** API Key for the census. Inside the `censusAPIKey.txt` it should look like this: [big long scramble of letters & numbers, no periods, no quotation marks]

Once you have those files uploaded, everything should work fine! Feel free to reach out with any questions [here](mailto:manpazito@berkeley.edu).
