# CYPLAN 101 – City Planning Data & Labs

This repository contains all labs and in-class demos for CYPLAN 101 at UC Berkeley.  
It supports the group project **“311 Neighborhood Equity”**, developed in collaboration with classmates and hosted in the shared repository:  
[https://github.com/manpazito/311-neighborhood-equity](https://github.com/manpazito/311-neighborhood-equity)

## Repository Structure

- **labs/** – Weekly lab notebooks, datasets, and figures.  
  Students must update their **API_KEY** in the lab notebooks before running any requests that use external data (for example, Census or Mapbox APIs).  
  The **A2 submission** should also be updated here.
- **in-class/** – Lecture and demo notebooks used during class sessions.
